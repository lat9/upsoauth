# upsoauth
A Zen Cart UPS shipping module that makes use of UPS' RESTful/Oauth API; see [this](https://developer.ups.com/tag/Rating) UPS link for the API documentation.  This module replaces both the [UPS](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=1293) and  [UPS-XML](https://www.zen-cart.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=126) shipping modules.   Those modules use interfaces to UPS that have been deprecated as of 2023.
